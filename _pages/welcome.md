The Calgary Intelligent Systems and Hardware (CalgaryISH) research group was started in 2019. Broadly speaking, our research group's interests include (but are not limited to):
- digital hardware design and electronic design automation (but largely before physical design)
- hardware security
- embedded systems
- large language models and their (un)helpfulness in software and hardware design

For a little peek into the kinds of things we're interested in, you can take a look at this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05832)
