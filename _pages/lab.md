The Calgary Intelligent Systems and Hardware (CalgaryISH) research group was started in 2021. Broadly speaking, our research group's interests include (but are not limited to):
- digital hardware design and electronic design automation (but largely before physical design)
- hardware security
- embedded systems
- large language models and their (un)helpfulness in software and hardware design

For a little peek into the kinds of things I'm interested in, you can take a look at this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05832)

*Prospective students:* Here's what to do if you want me to reply...
